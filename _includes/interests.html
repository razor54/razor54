			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>Infrastrucutre automation</b>. I belive that automating the infrastructure is an important first step to achieve 'no downtime' web application, as it avoid human error as much as possible.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Keyboards</b>. I've recently been in contact with the world of custom mechanical keyboards, I find it amazing that you can build your own keyboard to fit your specific needs and at the same time bringing you the best typing experience as possible. If you're typing on a keyboard for 8 hours a day, it better be a good experience.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Exercise</b>. I think that physical exercise is one of the most important things in any one's life, as it improves you're well being, lowering the overall stress, and in turn improving your efficiency at work.
      </li>

  			<li>
          <b>Anvil</b> — an Internal Developer Platform built in Go. Developers declare high-level intents ("I need a web app") and Anvil resolves the full infrastructure graph — VPC, ECS, RDS, ALB — without writing Terraform or CloudFormation. Includes a CLI, gRPC daemon, GitOps flow, and AI guardrails.
    		</li>
  			<li>
          <b>CKA Practice Lab</b> — a hands-on Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam preparation environment with 60 exercises across all exam domains, a local kind cluster, and automated solution verification scripts.
